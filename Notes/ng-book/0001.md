# Chapter 1
- browser will rendering the html, rendering means that through several operation in order to display the website

# Chapter 2
- ng-app 声明所被包含内容为 angular js application
- we can think that view is a reflection of model, when client model changes, then the view will do changes accordingly 
- Model View Controller 
    - model include application data and methods to exchange data
    - view display data to user
    - controller is the bridge to connect each other
- Dirty checking is used to check whether the model changes
- Model object ($scope is an object which the attribute are able to used and exchange data with controller)
- The best way to do data-binding is go through view object attribute not the object itself )

# Chapter 3 Module
- one application can have many different module and each module define the usage of it
- benefit of module which make the global clean, reusable
- angular js use **angular.module()** to declare module and it accepts two parameter which first is the **name** of the module, second will be an **array** of dependencies 
```
angular.module('myApp',[]);
```
- 调用这个方法只需要一个参数就能用来引用模块; 通常会使用多个模块来细分复杂功能，这样有助于testing。

# Chapter 4 作用域 scope
- apply mechanism can inform the changes of the application
- the desired framework is put the application business logic in controller, all related data in controller scope
- rootScope is the parent of scope (not recommend to do changes on rootScope because it is similiar with global scope)
- scope is the bridge bewteen view and html

- What scope can do?
    - watch data model 
    - inform what the changes about data model to application
    - seperate data and function

- use controller to create a $scope object
- use ng-controller directive to add into DOM element
- normally we creae a controller to control those variables 

#example
```
    <div ng-app="myApp">
        <div ng-controller="myCtrl">
            <h1>Hello {{ name }}</h1>
        </div>
    </div>

    angular.module('myApp',[])
           .controller('myCtrl', function($scope){
                $scope.name = "ari";
           });
```
