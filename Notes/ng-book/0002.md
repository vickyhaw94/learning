# Chapter 4 作用域 scope
- apply mechanism can inform the changes of the application
- the desired framework is put the application business logic in controller, all related data in controller scope
- rootScope is the parent of scope (not recommend to do changes on rootScope because it is similiar with global scope)
- scope is the bridge bewteen view and html

- What scope can do?
    - watch data model 
    - inform what the changes about data model to application
    - seperate data and function

- use controller to create a $scope object
- use ng-controller directive to add into DOM element
- normally we creae a controller to control those variables 

#example
```
    <div ng-app="myApp">
        <div ng-controller="myCtrl">
            <h1>Hello {{ name }}</h1>
        </div>
    </div>

    angular.module('myApp',[])
           .controller('myCtrl', function($scope){
                $scope.name = "ari";
           });
```
